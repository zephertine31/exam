Complete a partially completed React teams and channel list application. Certain core React functionalities have already been implemented. Complete the application as shown below in order to pass all the unit tests.

The application has 2 components:

*   The TeamList component, which presents a list of teams and an input to add a new team.
*   The Team component, which displays a list of channels for each team and an input to add a new channel.

The application has the following functionalities:

*   For the TeamList component:
    *   Each team in the teams array has the following keys:

        *   name: The name of the team. (String)

        *   channels: The list of channels belonging to a team. (Channel Array)

    *   Initially, the "Add Team" button is disabled.
    *   It becomes enabled only when a **unique**, valid team name having at least one character is entered in the input.
    *   Upon clicking the enabled "Add Team" button, the team is added to the Teams List.
*   For the Team component:
    *   Each channel in a team has the following keys:

        *   name: The name of the channel. (String)

        *   id: The unique ID for the channel. (Integer)

    *   Initially, the "Add Channel" button is disabled.
    *   It becomes enabled only when a **unique**, valid channel name having at least one character is entered in the input.
    *   Upon clicking the enabled "Add Channel" button, the channel is added to the Team component.
    *   While adding a new channel, a new unique incremental ID property has to be provided.
    *   Clicking the _delete_ button on any channel removes it from the list.

The following data-testid attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:

*   The div with the list of teams should have the data-testid attribute 'team-list'.
*   The lists of channels for each team should have the data-testid attributes 'channel-list-0', 'channel-list-1', and so on.
*   The 'Add Team' button should have the data-testid attribute 'add-team-btn'.
*   Each 'Add Channel' button should have the data-testid attribute 'add-channel-btn-0', 'add-channel-btn-1', and so on.
*   The 'Enter Team Name' input should have the data-testid attribute 'team-name-input'.
*   Each 'Enter Channel Name' input should have the data-testid attribute 'channel-name-input-0', 'channel-name-input-1', and so on.
*   Each _delete_ button should have the data-testid attribute 'remove-channel-button-00', 'remove-channel-button-01', and so on, denoting first the team id and then the channel id.

Please note that component has the above data-testid attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. It is advised not to change them.
